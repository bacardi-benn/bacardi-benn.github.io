<p>My name is Benjamin Morton and I am currently a senior at Clemson University majoring in Accounting and minoring in Mathematical Sciences.
<br />When I am not studying for school, I enjoy playing musical instruments such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH7O1xoySds">piano
</a>, guitar, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46hZBXiZxas">tinwhistle</a>, tinkering with my Linux operating system, and viewing constellations and meteor showers.</p>
