<p>My name is Benjamin Morton and I am currently a senior at Clemson University majoring in Accounting and minoring in Mathematical Sciences. <br />When I am not studying for school, I enjoy playing musical instruments such as <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiaH1mpODrk">piano</a>, guitar, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46hZBXiZxas">tinwhistle</a>, tinkering with my Linux operating system, and viewing constellations and meteor showers.
